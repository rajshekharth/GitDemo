Section 13 challenge
---------------------
---------------------

For this challenge you are to develop the foundation for a program
for movie fanatics to keep track of what movies they have watched and
how many times they watched each movie.

The program must support the following:

class Movie - models a movie which includes 
- Movie name
- Movie rating (G, PG, PG-13, R)
- watched - the numbre of times the movie is watched


class Movies - models a collection of movie objects

Obviously, Movies needs to know about Movie since it is a collection of Movie object.
However, our main driver should only interact with the Movies class.

For example: a simple main should be able to 
- create a Movies object
- ask the Movies object to add a movie by providing the movie name, rating and watched count
- ask the Movies object to increment the watched count by 1 for a movie given its name
- ask the Movies object to display all of its movies.

Additionally,
- if we try to add a movie whose name is already in the collection, we should display this
error to the user
- if we try to increment the watched count for a moview whose name is not in the movies 
collection we should display this error to the user

Here is what project folder should look like:
-Movie.h: include file with the Movie class specification
-Movie.cpp: file with the Movie class implementation
-Movies.h: include file with the Movies class specification
-Movies.cpp: file with the Movies class implementation
-main.cpp: the main driver that creates a Movies object and adds and increments movies

Here is sample main and the output. Make sure you understand the program flow before
you start coding.
